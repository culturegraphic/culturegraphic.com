      p Hi, I&rsquo;m Nate. I lead teams that design products and brands for real-world impact. I created Obama&rsquo;s 2008 online ads in Chicago, ran a product &amp; brand studio in Brooklyn, and art directed ads at Ogilvy Paris. I was the founding designer at Change.org where I built a talented team and helped grow a global platform that would see a campaign victory every hour. I was raised in Milwaukee and indoctrinated into civic engagement by parents who met working for Cesar Chavez. I&rsquo;ve lived in eight cities across four countries and today I live in San Francisco, leading the Social Impact design team at Facebook. I have a degree in Interactive Art Direction from Hyper Island in Sweden and teach Civic Design at California College for the Arts.
